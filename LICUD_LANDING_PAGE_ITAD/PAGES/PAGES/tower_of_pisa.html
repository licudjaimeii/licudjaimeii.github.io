	<blockquote><blockquote><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a medieval structure in Pisa, Italy, that is famous for the settling of its foundations, 
	which caused it to lean 5.5 degrees (about 15 feet/4.5 metres) from the perpendicular in the late 20th century. 
	Extensive work was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees.</blockquote></blockquote></h2>

	<blockquote><blockquote><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get there, take the train from Florence to Pisa, walk or take a taxi to the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
	It is recommended to go on morning to witness the best view of the said landmark. When you wish to clim until the very top of the building, ticket is sold for 18â‚¬.
