		<sup>1</sup>I am Jaime II Ruaro Licud.<sup>1</sup>
		I was born on the 9th of August, 2001.<sup>2</sup> 
		I was the eldest son of Jaymelene and Mar Licud.<sup>3</sup>  
		I was named after my grandfather, Jaime.<sup>4</sup>
		Most people usually guess if my father was the same as my first name, but they were wrong.<sup>5</sup>
		Growing up in a religious family and happy relationship with my relatives and grandparents. <sup>6</sup>
		I am spoiled by my grandfather, he always makes me happy back then, one time he ordered a burger just for the two of us. <sup>7</sup>
		I took elementary on Colegio de San Juan de Letran with my two cousins. <sup>8</sup>
		I was known in the school back then as a naughty little boy. <sup>9</sup>
		I did pee in the computer laboratory room back then and dislocated my teacher's arm because she fell when she was chasing me.<sup>10</sup>
		During my childhood, my grandfather died exactly on my birthday, with a little consciousness around me, 
		I realized that my grandfather is peacefully asleep when I saw him for the last time and that is the reason 
		why I don't feel happy whenever my birthday comes. <sup>11</sup>
		My mother had another baby and that is now my younger sister.<sup>12</sup>
		I stayed only for a year in my school and we went to my father's province so that my father will focus on his job while my mother supervises us. <sup>13</sup>
		I schooled in the province until I finished sixth grade. <sup>14</sup>
		Along the way, I met new friends, peers, had fun with my cousins.<sup>15</sup>
		I also joined a young choir in my religion in that area.<sup>16</sup>
		Living in a province is not as boring as you could have imagined.<sup>17</sup>
		In the province, you feel free, the air is fresh than the city,
		you can run as far as you can and indeed enjoying childhood in a province is something I did not expect in the first place when I was new in our province. <sup>18</sup>
		But I have to go back to the city to continue my education. <sup>19</sup>
		I found it hard to leave what I enjoyed in the past years of my childhood.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<sup>1</sup>In the summer of  2013, my family and I were looking for a school. <sup>1</sup>
		Luckily, we found a school which is affordable and at the same, near our house.<sup>2</sup>
		My sister and I enrolled in the University of the East and knowing that I was part of the second batch for the K-12 program, I have to spend 6 years in high school. <sup>3</sup>
		On the first day of classes, I remembered that I was the only one wearing civilian clothing while the rest is wearing uniforms. <sup>4</sup>
		I met my first friend on the first day named Mahathir. <sup>5</sup>
		Day passed by, I found more friends and found a solid section in that year. <sup>6</sup>
		In the seventh grade is where I started to be competitive with others but also being friendly at the same time.<sup>7</sup>
		The eighth grade is my toughest one because my friends and I were not in the same section and I made new friends. <sup>8</sup>
		I pushed my studies hard at that time and it came to a point wherein an exam on PE is tomorrow and I was reviewing the night before. <sup>9</sup>
		I cried because the room is so noisy and my family supported me and they went to the living room for the sake of me having peace reviewing and in the end I got first honors at the end of my eighth-grade year.<sup>10</sup>
		The most memorable part of my teenage years is my tenth grade and my senior high school years. <sup>11</sup>
		In the tenth grade where I found my close friends, and also that is the year when we had a cookery class every morning. <sup>12</sup>
		I enjoyed the last year of my junior high school days. <sup>13</sup>
		I and my friends parted ways because of our passions in senior high school tracks but we didn't forget each other, there are times we meet every time at the corridors. <sup>14</sup>
		But one of my friend went to other country to migrate and she stopped her school and went with her family.<sup>15</sup>
		We were eleventh-grade that time.<sup>16</sup>
		I didn't even said my goodbye to her but we didn't forget each other.<sup>17</sup>
		In fact, we sometimes chat to greet each other and communicate.<sup>18</sup>
		I nurtured my last two years of and made a lot friends and some of my friends from my seventh-grade classmate was my classmate in my senior high school days. <sup>19</sup>
		The one of memorable from my senior high school days was reviewing at my fullest a week before my college entrance test and after I took the test, my grade was just "3".<sup>20</sup>
		That time, I said to myself, how am I even going to survive college.<sup>21</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<sup>1</sup>When I was going to the school for enrollment. I saw one of my friends and knowing we have the same course, he quickly said his section, and I enrolled in the same class with him. <sup>1</sup>
		I'm glad that I enrolled with him because some of my friends from my senior-high-school days were my classmate on the first day of my college days.<sup>2</sup>
		We met new friends and faced how different high school to college was. <sup>3</sup>
		In the first semester, we were chill and everything was going smooth sailing and when every final examination comes, we were panicking, procrastinating and luckily we survived the first semester of being a college student.<sup>4</sup>
		In an unexpected condition, during the second semester, a pandemic spread from a country and later on reached around the world.<sup>5</sup>
		A quarantine was implemented around the country in March and during the summer period, instead of wasting my time doing nothing.<sup>6</sup>
		Jacob and I decided to enroll in a summer class offered by the university. <sup>7</sup>
		We took the chance to maybe reduce the stress and time that we will use in our third year.<sup>8</sup>
		Throughout the summer class, we met new friends, faced many situations, and to try the so-called "online class".<sup>9</sup>
		The online class was difficult compared to face to face classes, some of our classmates experienced troubles in attending this kind of classes like out of electricity, out of mobile data, and so on.<sup>10</sup>
		Even today, we experience those said experiences that hindrances for each one of us to attend a class.<sup>11</sup>
		Despite how hard life was right now, my friends and I got a scholarship from the school due to our grade average from last semester.<sup>12</sup>
		We really worked hard for this because this is totally our main goal is from the very start of our college life.<sup>13</sup>
		We aimed for it and worked for it thinking that it is worth the risk and it did.<sup>14</sup>
		Recently, for the past two or three weeks has passed. I had symptoms of the so-called flu that spreads today. <sup>15</sup>
		Even though I didn't feel good at that time, I still continued my studies today, and thank God I quickly recovered from it and kept going on.<sup>16</sup>
		As of now, our professors told us about what we students should expect in our third years and final years in college.<sup>17</sup>
		They told us about requirements, the importance of thesis groups, and so on.<sup>18</sup>
		But, my friends and I have only an ultimate goal, and that is to graduate whatever it takes.<sup>19</sup>
		There may be more challenges that we will encounter during our college days, especially this pandemic that makes things worse.<sup>20</sup>
		I realized that in college, helping each other is a key to pass this task and also finish with a high note which is to graduate. <sup>21</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
