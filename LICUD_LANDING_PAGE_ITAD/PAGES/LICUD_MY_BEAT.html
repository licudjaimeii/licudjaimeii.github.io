	<blockquote><blockquote><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In the genre of K-Pop, Twice is my favorite girl group next to Blackpink. Not only they have a good transitions,
	thinking that they have 9 members on that group creating a 3 by 3 triangular choreography. The reason why I chose
	this as my favorite girl group is that Twice's members can be divided into rap part of the song, or main vocal or the
	main dancer that has more screen time that others and the fact that each of the members are equally seen through out 
	their music videos.</blockquote></blockquote></h2>

	The first K-Pop group I ever heard of as I start to know about K-Pop. I started getting interested in BTS from
	2017 when my friend told me that maybe I could try to hear it sometime and became a fan after it. They were
	stunning on their visuals and their choreography is on point based from their songs being played. Their screen
	time sometimes doesn't equal from each of them because most of the screen time is for their main vocalists. BTS 
	is a boy group that consists of 7 members: 4 for vocalists and 3 for rappers.</blockquote></blockquote></h2>

	My second favorite girl group. Blackpink has 4 members, each of them are very talented because sometimes they would hit a high
	note and sometimes they can rap a line/verse on their songs. On their music videos, their screen time were distributed
	well because they have less memebers than other girl groups. On the genre of K-Pop, Twice and Blackpink was battling 
	for the top spot in the side of girl groups.</blockquote></blockquote></h2>

	expresses the mood so well that it matches whatever kind of song he wants.</blockquote></blockquote></h2>
